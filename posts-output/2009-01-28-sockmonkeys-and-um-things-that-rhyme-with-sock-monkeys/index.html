I'm a terrible sketcher, and making actual real things that you can drop on your foot is something that is largely alien to me - I don't usually have the patience to persevere after about 90 seconds, and usually give up straight afterwards. As you'd imagine, is a bit of a barrier when it comes to making stuff.</p><p>But something amazing happened this weekend - I actually made something physical, and I now know the joy and pride a maker feels when they craft an entirely new object from simple mundane parts.</p><h3>Of course, it didn't go totally smoothly to begin with:</h3>
[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="My one is the rude looking stripey one "]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/daggi/3227593069/in/photostream/"><img title="Unfinished Sock Monkey" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3509/3227593069_b5c0a3dcd2.jpg" alt="My one is the rude looking stripey one " width="500" height="333" /></a>[/caption]
<p>This was my first attempt at making a sock monkey at the Crafternoon put by Jo Maiden of the <a title="Ethical Fashion Forum" href="http://www.ethicalfashionforum.com/">Ethical Fashion Forum</a>, a fundraising event where the proceeds went towards a project to set up an ethical fashion production facility in Soko, Kenya, that directly supplies the UK retail trade. </p><p>We turned up at the Hub with a fiver and a pair of socks with us, and in return, we were taught how to make a monkeys from socks, and given more tea and cake than we could possibly eat. This is a good way to spend a Satruday afternoon.</p><p>I could say more, but the chances are the penile appendage coming out the sock monkey's chest has probably distracted you somewhat. And rightly so; it's an abomination.</p><p>Like I said before, there are people who are good with their hands, and I'm not one of them.</p><p>But mercifully, there's a sewing kit at home, and when I headed home at the end of the day on Saturday, I took the instruction set with me, and over the weekend, managed to remove the unintentionally hilarious phallus/arm hybrid growing out of the torso, and end up with something with a passing resemblance to what a sockmonkey is supposed to look like.</p><p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="375" caption="My sockmonkey, post-op"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/daggi/3228458626/in/set-72157612960070327/"><img title="Finished sockmonkey" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3434/3228458626_76e1142057.jpg" alt="Sockmonkey, post-op" width="375" height="500" /></a>[/caption]</p><p>The stitching on this is terrible, it's badly stuffed, I made an embarrassing number of false starts, where I had to undo loads of stitching and redo work, and in all, it took me absolutely aaaaaaaages to make, but despite this, it's <em>my</em> misshapen, badly stitched soft toy, and I'm pretty damn proud of it.</p><p>And it's also helped me get past whatever block I had when it came to handling garments, needles and threads. I'm actually fixing and adjusting my own clothes now - this week, for the first time in years, trousers that were too long finally fit me, so I don't have to do a adopt a strange hop-step gait to avoid destroying them as I walk through the streets of London.</p><h3>Interested?</h3>
If this kind of stuff interests you, you could do a lot worse than check out <a title="The Make Lounge" href="http://themakelounge.com/">The Make Lounge</a> just off Liverpool in Angel Islington - they run workshops like this regularly, and while they're more expensive, I'm told that the post-workshop glow is similarly euphoric. Alternatively, you there's always O'Reilly's <a title="Craft Magazine" href="http://www.craftzine.com/">Craft Magazine</a>, and if you're free on Feb 4th and like the look of this event, there's another Fundraiser for the Soko project.
<p>There are people who are good with their hands, and I'm not one of them <em>yet</em>, but it doesn't feel out of reach forever now.</p><p>Huzzah!</p>
