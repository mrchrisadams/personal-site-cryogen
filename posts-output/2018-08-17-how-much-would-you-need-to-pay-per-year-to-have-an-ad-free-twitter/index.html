Hear me out: How about if we *pay* a small subscription fee for Twitter and they stop fucking everything up trying to make money every way except charging for their service.</p></blockquote><p>There was another example, by Ben Hammersley saying largely the same thing last year, but since he started deleting his tweets automatically, I can't point to it now.</p><p>Anyway the gist is the same - <em>why don't we just club together to buy it out? </em>If we did that it wouldn't be the same cesspit is now, compared to the fun service is was when we started?</p><p>I like the idea for this, but I think it would cost more than most people are prepared to pay - something in the region of 200 - 250 USD is my best guess, to make more money than Twitter's own reporting said it makes from advertising.</p><p>Given that app.net and others weren't able to charge anywhere near that and fizzled out, I'm not sure how this would end up better for Twitter.</p><h3>My workings</h3><p>My workings and assumptions are in this spreadsheet, which I shared last time I saw this idea, and I'd really be interested in hearing which assumptions ought to be updated to make this possible, as I've shared mine below:</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Baa08XSFCL1O8dvlMit8fnEjaGjxfZNrtVR9GDWh1lE/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Baa08XSFCL1O8dvlMit8fnEjaGjxfZNrtVR9GDWh1lE/edit#gid=0</a></p><p>Make a copy, share a link back.</p><p>If that's not your jam, the comments are open below, and my DMs are open on twitter - I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/mrchrisadams">@mrchrisadams</a>.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
