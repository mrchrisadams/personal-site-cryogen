    <!-- content below --><p>I had to do a bit of server-side troubleshooting on Wordpress site recently, that had been hacked. It's not a popular site, and hardly gets any traffic, and was simple enough to fix, but it's worth noting the actions I had to take.</p><p>I'm trying to find a mental model that fits this process, to make it easier to remember what to do in future, so I figured I'd share my approach here:</p><h3 id="1-stop-the-bleeding">1) Stop the bleeding</h3><p>In this case, the hack had been down to a malicious script being able to sign into the site, using the <code>admin</code> credentials, and a dictionary-attacking the password until the weak password was broken. A simple fix for this is to change the password to something stronger, and be change the name of the admin account, so it's no longer such a target for scripts.</p><p>Changing the password for an user account is pretty mundane, but changing the name of a user account is slightly more exotic.</p><p>Here's a handy mysql snippet for this, once you're logged in at the mysql shell:</p><pre lang="sql">
    update wp_users set user_nicename='new.harder.to.hack.name' where user_nicename='admin';
    update wp_users set user_login='new.harder.to.hack.name' where user_login='admin';
</pre><h3 id="2-clean-the-infection">2) Clean the infection</h3><p>Now you have this, it's worth looking for the culprit. In many cases, you'll see an unfamiliar php file in the <code>uploads</code> directory. It'll often have a url like this: <code>img_112.php</code>, and you might be able to see it in server logs as a request like this:</p><pre>
    http://hackedsite.co.uk/wp-content/img_112.php?SOMESTRING_OF_PARAMETERS_
</pre><p>Unless you have very good reasons to have executable php files in your upload diretories, it's best to remove any.</p><h3 id="3-keep-it-clean">3) Keep it clean</h3><p>Now that you've stopped further attacks, and removed any malicious scripts from within your site, it's a good time to lock down permissions on any files on your site. If you're running Wordpress under a virtual private server, the snippet below should work fine, if you run them from within the <code>wordpress directory</code>:</p><pre lang="bash">
  find /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
</pre><p>If you're like me and can never remember the syntax for the <code>find</code> command, here's a sort of translation of what it means:</p><blockquote><p>starting within the directory "/path/to/your/wordpress/install/", start a <em>find</em>, looking only for results of the type file (shown by <code>-type f</code>). Then, for each result, execute the command (using the <code>-exec</code> flag) <code>chmod 644</code> on them, to restrict how the files can be modified on the server.</p></blockquote><p>Now that we've done files, we'll need to to the directories too:</p><pre lang="bash">
  find /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
</pre><p>This is almost the same as the previous command except that a) we're only looking for directories (specified by the <code>-type d</code> flag), and we're allowing slightly more relaxed permissions, because we're dealing with directories instead files  (<code>chmod 755</code> versus <code>chmod 644</code>).</p><p>Once we've cleaned up permissions on our site, now we can turn to some plugins to help automate some of the drudgework of keeping a site sufficiently secure. I've found <a href="http://l3rady.com/projects/wordpress-file-monitor-plus/">WordPress File Monitor Plus</a> useful for detecting malicious changes to your site in future, and if you can see past the rather bombastic name, [Ultimate Security Checker][2], gives a number of simple steps you can follow to further harden up your site.</p><h4 id="is-this-even-vaguely-coherent">Is this even vaguely coherent?</h4><p>So there we have it - (hopefully) a simple enough explanation of how you might fix a site after it's been compromised by some opportunist or semi automated hacking scripts, and a useful way to to think about site in future.</p><h4 id="where-to-learn-more">Where to learn more</h4><p>If you're interested in looking into this in more detail, right now this presentation below seems to the best one I can find about the subject. And as ever, [the Codex][3] is wealth of useful information</p><p>[embed]http://www.slideshare.net/williamsba/wordpress-security-1709496[/embed]</p><!-- links --><p>[2]: (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ultimate-security-checker/ "WordPress - Ultimate Security Checker WordPress - Plugins")
