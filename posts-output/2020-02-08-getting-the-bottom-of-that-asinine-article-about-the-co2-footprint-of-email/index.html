What's more, these email newsletters are often huge, to provide more chances to engage and click through for each call to action.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you compare the impact of just the transmission of sending data, the impact of organisations sending hundreds of newsletters will <em>dwarf</em> the occasional reply by a human, and focussing on the individual is utterly stupid.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In fact, you can see this, because the journalist at least had the decency to <a href="https://www.ovoenergy.com/ovo-newsroom/press-releases/2019/november/think-before-you-thank-if-every-brit-sent-one-less-thank-you-email-a-day-we-would-save-16433-tonnes-of-carbon-a-year-the-same-as-81152-flights-to-madrid.html">link to the original Ovo Energy Press release talking about how green they are</a>, and how responsible they are for bashing together an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ovo-carbon-capper/fhnhofnjjgdecmbjjjikhekdmepoejnk?hl=en-GB">an email tracking chrome extension they call Carbon Capper</a>. Here's the specific bit from the press release:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote --><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>To help combat the issue, OVO Energy has created the world’s first carbon reducing Chrome Extension - Carbon Capper. When downloaded, the extension identifies when the user has hit send on a potentially unnecessary email, sending a prompt to ensure more thoughtful email traffic. The Extension tracks word count, flagging emails under four words, and allows users to keep a close eye on their individual email carbon footprint.</p></blockquote><!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Here's a screenshot.

Read pieces like this from people who leave these companies, like this one by Bruce Hahne when he left Google:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote --><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If Google’s cloud and AI/ML technology can reduce the overall costs of finding, extracting, and processing oil and gas, and reduce the cost of oil and gas power plants by even 1% — and I certainly could believe that 1% is possible — the results for the planet will be dire. More large-scale investment dollars diverted to oil and gas, more oil and gas refineries built, more oil and gas extracted, while zero-carbon energy generation gets deployed more slowly, or simply not deployed at all because the capital investment is going into cheaper oil and gas. That’s how we die by fire – one cost-reducing Google cloud service at a time.</p><p>(snip)</p><p>The harm that Google Cloud will do to the planet, if it reduces underlying costs of this industry by even a small percent, completely dwarfs the data center decarbonization work.</p><p></p><cite><a href="https://www.alphabetworkers.org/resignation-letter/">Bruce Hahne, in his resignation letter</a></cite></blockquote><!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Worry instead about consulting companies you admire doing the same</strong>, and helping the same oil and gas companies, but keeping quiet about doing so.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Worry about how blase we are about flying when it makes up a significant chunk of company emissions</strong> in many tech consultancies and enterprise sales teams.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Below are the figures from <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/company-environment-charts">Accentures 2018 CSR report</a>.
