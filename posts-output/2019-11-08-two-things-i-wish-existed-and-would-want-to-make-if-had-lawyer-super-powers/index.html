You can see precedents set where <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/speced/2015/08/Accessibility%20Concerns%20Delay%20$30M%20Amazon%20E-Book%20Contract%20in%20N.Y.C..html">NYC public schools forced Amazon kindle to be more accessible</a>, which has now ended up creating norms for private sector too, like in the case where <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/07/dominos-supreme-court.html">a blind man has successfully sued Domino's Pizza for building an inaccessible site</a>.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Why I think this would help</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I say this because I understand more than 50% of UK councils to have declared a climate emergency now.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But without any mechanism to act upon this declaration, I worry that it's just a feel good gesture, and any momentum from doing it will be lost.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If there's some legal basis to back up the science, which we all seem be ignoring, at least it can lead to a conversation along the lines of:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote --><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"OK, what does acting as if there was a climate emergency look like?".</p></blockquote><!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The goal here isn't to penalise people for declaring a climate emergency, but instead to create the legal mechanism to allow the people pushing for it, to push for action, rather than being fobbed off with a response like <em>"we already declared it, we're done!"</em>.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The people campaigning for things like emergency declarations shouldn't need to be policy experts or technocrats, but their reasonable wishes of keeping a world safe for their and their friends children should be respected.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I've been working with a friend, James Gardner to sketch out some ideas along the lines of a "ten tonne rule". I'm hoping these two sentences on how to use will outline the idea behind the ten tonne rule:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><em>If any spend will cause more than 10 tonnes of CO2 emissions, rank bids by CO2 emitted over length of the contract.</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><em>Suppliers show the workings for their CO2 figures in bids. Favour the lowest.</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href="https://www.jimmyg.org/carbon/10-tonne-rule/index.html">James has written some more on his site</a>.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
