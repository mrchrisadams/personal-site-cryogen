    <!-- content below --><p><em>Now that GPDR has landed, we're seeing companies serving EU specific versions of their site to EU users, which in some cases, serve a user experience which is cleaner, simpler and faster loading.</em></p><p><em>Some are </em>much<em> smaller over the wire too. So, because moving data uses servers,and those servers use electricity, and that electricity usually comes from burning coal, I've had a go at doing some basic calculations to work out what the CO2 reductions might be if these became the norm.</em></p><p><em><strong>TLDR - </strong>For a site like USAtoday,</em> <em>it looks like running the 'GPDR-lite' version as the default would represent CO2 emissions savings equivalent to an entire European persons's annual carbon footprint, each month.</em></p><h3>How I arrive at these numbers</h3><p>I need to stress right at the beginning - these figures I'm about to share are very rough, and I don't pretend that they're in any final, accurate form at all.</p><p>I'm hoping to share this to help get a better idea for how you might work out the CO2 emissions associated with transferring data in a more rigorous fashion,  but also because I think these emissions are worth discussing, and I can't find any numbers like this online yet.</p><h3>First, our smaller site:</h3><p>Let's take Hadley's tweet here - she's referring to a the EU specific version of the USA Today site, which is about 500kb, compared to the full size, ads and tracking site which weighs in at 5mb site instead:</p><p>https://twitter.com/hadleybeeman/status/1000435217109278721</p><p>What kind of energy footprint does this represent? Let's take a rough estimate of the total daily traffic <a href="https://www.easycounter.com/report/usatoday.com">for the USAToday from EasyCounter</a> (we could use Alexa if we wanted to pay for more accurate traffic results)</p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2990" src="https://mrchrisadamsblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-27-at-16-45-50.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-27 at 16.45.50.png" width="2130" height="1006" /><p>Looking here, we get 3.77 million daily page views.</p><p>So, if we wanted an <em>idea </em>of daily bandwidth, we might multiply page size by daily page views.</p><p>So, lets take a 5MB page, and multiply it 3.77 million times to represent the page views.</p><p>This gives us a figure, that, when we round it to the nearest one hundred gigabytes, is about <strong>18,400 gigabytes of data per day.</strong></p><h3>How much energy is that?</h3><p>Now, it's been <em>really hard</em> to find reliable numbers to convert bandwidth to energy usage when I've looked before, but the <a href="http://www.koomey.com/post/165024508933">best freely available figures I've found are from work I found via Jonathan Koomey's blog</a>, where he shares something like this:</p><p><em>This article derives criteria to identify accurate estimates over time and provides a new estimate of <strong>0.06 kWh/GB</strong> for 2015. By retroactively applying our criteria to existing studies, we were able to determine that the electricity intensity of data transmission (core and fixed-line access networks) has decreased by half approximately every 2 years since 2000 (for developed countries),</em></p><p>So, this is semi-throwaway blog post and it's a Sunday, and so for the purposes of getting a ballpark figure, I'm going to cheat and just project forward two years to 2017, and say 2018 is close enough to 2017 for me to use <strong><em>0.03 kWh/GB</em>.</strong></p><h3>Okay, how much carbon dioxide is that?</h3><p>For a ballpark figure like this, we'd take the total energy needed to transfer our 18,400 gigabytes per day, then multiply that by our 0.03 kilowatt hours per gigabyte, then multiply <em>that</em> by the CO2 emissions per kilowatt hour.</p><h4>Let's get our CO2 per kilowatt hour figure so we can do this</h4><p>In the US, where most of the USAToday audience is likely to be, a fair amount of coal is used to generate power, so when I was dumping some numbers into this jupyter notebook, I made a guesstimate figure of <strong>0.45 kilograms of CO2</strong> emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated.</p><p>After checking it against the <a href="https://emissionsindex.org">emissions index website to check against some actual numbers</a>, it turns out I was off, but not <em>that</em> far off.</p><p>Their figure is 432 kilograms per megawatt hour, which is about <strong>0.43 kilograms of CO2 per kilowatt</strong> <strong>hour</strong>.</p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2991" src="https://mrchrisadamsblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-27-at-16-56-42.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-27 at 16.56.42.png" width="1604" height="1238" /><p>I've been rounding at each stage here, to make it a bit easier to keep the numbers a bit easier to remember.</p><p>However, I'm going to pull the <a href="https://github.com/productscience/planet-friendly-web/blob/master/binder/co2-savings-usatoday-gdpr.ipynb">actual number from the jupyter notebook</a>, which when rounded again, gives us <strong>248.5kg of CO2 per day, or a little under 7.5 tonnes per month more or less.</strong></p><h3><strong>Translating this into something  more tangible</strong></h3><p>If we had the lighter, GPDR friendly, ad-and-tracking-free version of the site as the norm, if we just looked at the bandwidth savings, then we'd be saving something like <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;series=EN.ATM.CO2E.PC&amp;country=#">the annual carbon footprint of a typical European, according to the World Bank</a>, every month.</p><p>Or if you prefer, something like <a href="https://co2.myclimate.org/en/portfolios?calculation_id=1171584">a flight between New York and Chicago every day</a>.</p><p>If this is interesting to you, there's some more <a href="https://github.com/productscience/planet-friendly-web/blob/master/binder/co2-savings-usatoday-gdpr.ipynb">in this jupyter notebook on github.</a></p><h3>Plug time - the planet friendly web guide</h3><p>I'm looking for people to work with and explore this kind of stuff with me.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Well, I work in tech, and it seems like loads of our existing tools, and practices can be re-purposed to bring about reductions in CO2 emissions in our industry AND make the digital products we create work better for our users.</p><p>If you design infra for services,where you source power, and how you provision your resources, to match your use (i.e. scaling) has an impact.</p><p>If you design clients, or apps, then how send data over the wire has an impact (i.e. WPO, et al).</p><p>If you design the business model, or how you get feedback from stakeholders, or how you travel to do all this, then decisions you make here have an impact too.</p><h4>Let's chat</h4><p>If this is interesting, please do get in touch, as I'm trying to:</p><ol><li>get a free, open source guide together around the subject at <a href="http://planetfriendlyweb.org/">planetfriendlyweb.org</a></li><li>prototype a workshop (one remote, one in Berlin), to help organisations identify where they can make these reductions (and usually, save money or reduce waste along the way)</li></ol><p>My <a href="https://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/contact/">contact page lists the usual ways to reach me</a>, and if the guide seems fun, <a href="http://planetfriendlyweb.org/contributing">there's a contributor page there too</a>.
