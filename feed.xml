I'll explain why in this post.</description><author>mrchrisadams</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/posts-output/2017-07-30-testing-formats-for-planet-friendly-web-workshops/</guid><link>http://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/posts-output/2017-07-30-testing-formats-for-planet-friendly-web-workshops/</link><title>Testing formats for planet friendly web workshops</title><description>I realise I never blogged about some exercises I did as part of thinking through what I'm calling the 'Planet Friendly Web', and given that I'm applying to conferences to explore this in more detail through talks or workshop activities, it seemed worth writing about here.</description><author>mrchrisadams</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/posts-output/2017-06-10-planet-friendly-web-development/</guid><link>http://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/posts-output/2017-06-10-planet-friendly-web-development/</link><title>Planet friendly web development with Python - a transcript</title><description>Over the last few months, I've spoken at a few conferences and meet-ups around Europe about what I'm calling the "Planet-Friendly Design" or "Planet-Friendly Web Development", to a mixture of UX focussed audiences, and developers.

With their permission, I'm sharing this write-up to help share examples of using Wardley maps in the wild, as a handy reference point for others.</description><author>chrisdaggimoh</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/posts-output/2017-05-02-ganzeer-my-new-favourite-writer/</guid><link>http://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/posts-output/2017-05-02-ganzeer-my-new-favourite-writer/</link><title>Ganzeer.
