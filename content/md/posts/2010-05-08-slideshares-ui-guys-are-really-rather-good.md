Every now and then, you come cross a piece interaction design that's so well executed, it'd be plain disrespectful not to write about it. Today, I had one of those moments on [Slideshare][2].

Very clever, these Slideshare chaps."]<a href="http://chrisadams.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Dropbox-Startup-Lessons-Learned1.png"><img src="http://chrisadams.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Dropbox-Startup-Lessons-Learned1-300x245.png" alt="annotated screenshot of slideshare" title="Dropbox Startup Lessons Learned" width="300" height="245" class="size-medium wp-image-254" /></a>[/caption]

I wanted to favourite this presentation by Drew Houston, [Dropbox Startup Lessons Learned][1], about how they applied lean startup principles internally at Dropbox, so I signed in to the site.

From there, I was 'upsold' into tagging the content (useful for me, but also useful for the site)

From there, I had already switched from being a passive consumer, to being an annotator, and from there it wasn't much of a jump to convert (note the deft use of clever micro-copy) to being a commenter, adding what (I hope) was some extra value to the page an increasing my engagement with the service.

Each step seemed natural, and unforced. 

Wow, these guys are good.
