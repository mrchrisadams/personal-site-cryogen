I'm currently trying to work out what this site is for at the mo, after looking at the sites of a [few][1] [of][2] [my][3] [friends][4] and [work][5] [colleagues'][6], and finding a degree of inspiration to finally get this site sorted out, so it's something I'd be prepared to actively tell people about.

Since discovering that I can happily write in markdown in Wordpress, and seeing that writing is coming a bit more easily to me now, I'm going to just write without thinking too hard about what comes onto here, and in the next month, use that to inform an actual redesign.

Bear with me, please, it'll all settle down in a bit.
