<p>As I understand it, to sell renewable energy in many countries, you generally need need to inform the regulator in your country about the renewable energy infrastructure you have, so you can be issued credits for the energy you produce (this doesn't cover every case, but a lot of them).</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.goodenergy.co.uk/blog/2017/08/15/green-tariffs-and-regos/">post from Good Energy</a> gives a very high level of what how these credits work.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how this data is licensed, or if you can download it in bulk anywhere as Open Data, but I do know it exists, and is collected, as it's used by the regulators anyway.</p>

<p>I live in Germany, and I'm trying to find this information. Does the German energy regulator maintain a register of renewable energy certificates, that you can download and analyse, like these two examples above? </p>
