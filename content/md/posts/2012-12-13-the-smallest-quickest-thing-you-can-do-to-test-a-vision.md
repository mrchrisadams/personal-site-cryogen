I came across a [lovely post by Bruce Durling][1], a friend I met through my various cleanweb escapades over the last year and a bit.

> For me, the problem with waterfall is that we end up waiting far too long to see if our original vision or strategy was worth pursuing.

> Agile is all about figuring out the smallest, quickest thing you can do to test a vision. And if the vision is right, then that thing should start to return some value to the business. If the vision was wrong, then it tells us that we need to change the vision.

I find this a really nice way to think about Agile as a tool for managing projects.
