I started writing this in a IRC channel earlier today, but I figured it might be useful share the question and the answer here, to capture it for others. Yes it is a bit lazyweb, but I can't be the only one doing this, and I'll share the answer here:

<blockquote>I'm working on a django project, and I'm interested in making a dockerfile so people who want to contribute, but don't use pip or pipenv regularly, but have used docker before can contribute.

I use circle CI for CI, and I use their docker files for running tests on the project. Is it common/recommended to use the same for easy dev environments?</blockquote>
