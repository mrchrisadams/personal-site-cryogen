<p>Hello internet - I'm doing one of those requests&nbsp; for help again. I pasted this to Facebook friends recently, but it seems worth putting here on my blog as well:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Okay facebook friends, I need your help.</p><p> Y'know how companies and orgs have CSR reports where they list their sources of emissions, and roughly what proportions of these emissions their activities represent?</p><p> I'm looking for stats like this on:</p><p> a) public sector bodies that employ lots of people but are primarily office based<br> b) service based companies or high tech companies that sell digital products</p><p> I'm asking this as even now, I couldn't tell you where I think the biggest sources of emissions in the majority of service-based organisations are, and have the data to back my reckons, and I don't think that many of you can either.</p><p> If we don't have this, how can we know we're being effective?</p><p> If you can share this with me, I'll start making viz and graphics, so at a glance we can have a more informed convo about this. I started doing this when I read drawdown recently to help me understand it better, and I want to do the same for something closer to home:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Yes, I know every company is unique.</p><p> But there will be patterns. We commute. We spend energy keeping people mostly warm and dry so they can be effective. We often have high paid people travelling quickly around the world.</p><p> Sure I know people who have access to this information? </p><p> Please share if you can - I've looked around and I've failed so far to find any thing usable at the organisation level.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>More notes</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm aware of scoped emissions according to the <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/corporate-standard">GHG Corporate Standard</a>, and I'm aware you can infer some kinds of activity from the distribution of an organisations' emissions among scopes 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p>This was one of the key ideas behind the stuff we were building at <a href="http://amee.com/">AMEE (Avoid Mass Exinction Engine),</a> when I was as developer and product manager there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The thing I'm looking for in particular is the <em>kind</em> of activity - what's the mean percentage for air travel, or office use and so on?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is this data published in any aggregate form? <em>ThatÂ </em>there is the thing I'm trying to understand.<br></p>
