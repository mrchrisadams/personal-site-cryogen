I'm no power user of Foursquare, but I'm pretty keen on the service - I think it's one of the most interesting startups around at present, but when asked why, I've never been able to clearly explain _why_ this is the case.

Recently though, I think a recent change to how their service works, has given me the final push to think hard enough to come up with a (hopefully) coherent explanation for my fascination.

Foursquare is changing how people relate to the built environment, (or if we skip such hoity-toity language, _places_), by adding the closest thing I can think of an usable, open API, to physical places, where we can poke and prod at what we see as socially acceptable, or desirable, in a social environment mediated by smart phones.

For instance, I've taken to checking in to places for three reasons:

a) to help create a trail of mementos around the world that I can look back at later on
b) to increase the likelihood of serendipitous encounters with friends or acquaintances
c) to see what I can learn about a given place, by seeing who visits there, and what they say about it

These reasons alone are enough to make the service compelling for as a user, but what really makes me want to write about it, is how they keep experimenting with ideas that walk in that blurry space where useful turns into creepy.

#### Checked in by a stranger

For example, earlier today, after heading into town to fix a coffee grinder I stopped off at Shoreditch Grind to get a coffee, (largely because Benugo was closed). I checked in, and about 3 minutes later, I was sent a message from Foursquare, asking me if I wanted to check-in, like so:

<a href="http://chrisadams.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0377.png"><img src="http://chrisadams.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0377.png" alt="" title="IMG_0377" width="640" height="960" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-570" /></a>

At the time I had forgot I had switched Foursquare's Radar on, so I was guessing that this was based on my GPS coordinates, and me being in one place for a given amount of time, but I didn't know any more than that. I can see how this would be useful, but if we imagine a spectrum running from comfortable to creepy, it was definitely closer to the creepy than comfortable.

#### How to make this less creepy?

Here's an updated screen I put together in Pixelmator, that would put make this whole interaction feel much more respectful:

The two principles I'm following here whenever something is introduced to a platform that may change your relationship to it:

- show me your working
- give me an off switch

In this revised version, when you get a message like this, if you're not sure why you're getting this (or in my case, you've forgot about Radar), then there's a way to find out about why you're reciving these notifications (I'm using the same way to denote a link to further content in the app already here), where presumably there was a way to switch Radar on or off, like you can on your Foursquare home screen.

How would you make a feature like this more approachable and friendly? I'd love to find out.
