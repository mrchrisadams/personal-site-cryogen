<em>o, I've just come back home from the most <a href="https://www.meetup.com/UX-Book-Club-Berlin/events/250204786/?_cookie-check=8gmDC61vDGTZKcid">recent UX Book Blub Berlin</a>, where we discussed <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/user-research-war-stories/">Doorbells, Danger, and Dead Batteries" by Steve Portigal.</a> I got a lot out of the evening, and agreed to share a few links to thing we discussed, but meetup.com doesn't let you share comments over a certain length, so I'm posting it here instead.</em>

<h3>ResearchOps</h3>

The first is the online ResearchOps Community (well, slack channel mainly), that Kat, Anja and I are in - it's online, at:

<a href="https://researchops.community">https://researchops.community</a>

Kat and I are also organising a workshop on June 22nd, which you can learn more about at the link below:

Here's the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/making-user-research-work-better-what-is-researchops-tickets-46140901679">link to where you can sign up</a>

<h3>Field Study Handbook</h3>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3001" src="https://mrchrisadamsblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sdrt-cover-0001-2-2-2_480x480.jpg" alt="sdrt-cover-0001-2-2-2_480x480" width="480" height="480" />

I think it was Franco who also mentioned the field study handbook - a colossal tome that's considered the final word in immersive research.

It's what I'd read up on if I ended up doing more of this kind of research. It also carries a formidable price tag of <a href="https://studiodradiodurans.com/products/the-field-study-handbook-2nd-edition">one hundred and twenty five bucks</a>.

<h3>Testessen and speed dating for testing products</h3>

I think it was Steve who mentioned <a href="https://usability-testessen.org/en/">Test Essen</a>, a sort of speed dating / user testing event to get quick feedback on products and prototypes. I hadn't heard of it before. See more below:

<h3>OMGDPR and research</h3>

Finally, I briefly mentioned an <a href="https://medium.com/omgdpr/omgdpr-in-berlin-at-soundcloud-2cebf1b173d7">unconference called OMGDPR</a> that took place few weeks back.

If there's interest, I'd be up for organising a small event to chat to other researchers, to get a better idea of how it's affecting their processes, as:

<ol>
    <li>the law is new</li>
    <li>it's effects are far reaching</li>
    <li>there are all kinds of question I have about how it affects how we do research, and I figure it might be useful exploring them with others</li>
</ol>

Anyway, catch y'all at the next Book club!
