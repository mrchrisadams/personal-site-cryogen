Over the last year or so, I've been doing variations for an idea I'm calling Planet Friendly Web, and after bumping into Paul Johnston at Monkigras earlier this year, then Jeffconf, we got chatting about a meetup for CTOs interested doing something about climate change.

I couldn't be there physically, but I did get a chance to put together a pre-recorded talk on steps we can take as technologists interested the environmental sustainability <em>of</em> the web.

It's 10 minutes long, and gives an overview of mental model I'm writing about in more detail atÂ <a href="https://www.planetfriendlyweb.org/">planetfriendlyweb.org</a>.

Here it is:

There's longer, 30 minute version I did for <a href="http://sustainableux.com">Sustainable UX</a>, that goes into things in more detail here:
