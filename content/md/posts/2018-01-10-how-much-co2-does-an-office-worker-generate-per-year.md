<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj">Hello internet friends. Would a kind soul be able to help me out here?</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>I'm doing a recorded 20 minute talk in Feb about the environmental impact of building digital products for a free online conference, <a href="http://sustainableux.com/">http://www.sustainableux.com</a>, and I'm looking for leads to work out a number I want to refer to in the talk.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>I'm after a single number, for the average carbon footprint of a single office worker, working in an office, full time, including their commute, in terms of tonnes of CO2 per year.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>I know commutes vary wildly, and that's fine. For this, an average will suffice, as I'm not pretending this will be accurate, just a ballpark figure.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>I think I'll mainly be speaking to an audience based in the US, or Europe, based on last year's viewer figures, so extra points if the number applies to those regions.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>I know this figure won't be precise, and I'm aware there are loads of factors that affect this anyway. To the nearest tonne is probably okay.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>If it helps, please think of this as a number for all those <strong>other places that aren't where you work. </strong>I appreciate your office might be super green and virtuous and you'd love to tell everyone about how much you recycle, and how you're going to eco-heaven, and how everyone is else is terrible but for the purposes of this request I don't think it will add to the conversation here. </span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>Sorry about sounding grumpy in that last para. I'll be super grateful and give you a shout out in the talk if you can find it.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></div>
