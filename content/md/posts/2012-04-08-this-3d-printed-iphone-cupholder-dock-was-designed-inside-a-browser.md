I came across [Shapesmith][] today, - it looks like an entirely browser borne, WebGL based 3D design tool, that lets you export models to be 3D printed. That in itself is pretty amazing.

Here's an example of something that the creator of the service knocked up for his drive to work, presumably:

<a href="http://chrisadams.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/scaled.jpg"><img src="http://chrisadams.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/scaled.jpg" alt="" title="3d printed iphone cupholder" width="640" height="257" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-717" /></a>

And then I read this:

> Up to now, you might have been able to build some really nice models with Shapesmith, but you couldn't share them except for exporting the printable STL version. What if you wanted to publish something for others to customize or improve? Now you can export and import models in a native JSON format, so you can publish and share your designs with others.

I can't believe how fast the 3D printing and design tools are progressing right now - it's mind boggling.
