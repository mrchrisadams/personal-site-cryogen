I recently was trying to debug why some snazzy passwordless sign-in flow wasn't working on Firefox for me, when it worked just fine on Chrome, and investigation lead to me reading up on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)</a>, a way to share access to resources (like images, js files and so on) across domains.

I'm really impressed by the writing, and something I thought I knew, I came away learning loads more about.

Good stuff.
