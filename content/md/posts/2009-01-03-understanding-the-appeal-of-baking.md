Baking has always been something of a black art to me.

I've privately marvelled over how simple, cheap base ingredients combine to the kinds of make culinary delights that trigger happy childhood memories, but it's always something I assumed was beyond my limited skills in the kitchen.

So today has been something of a revelation: mum showed me how she makes the mince pies that I grew up loving, and I've spent a fair chunk of the day practicing until I'm happy with the results.

And now, it's safe to say, I'm pretty happy.
