I'm working with Drupal a lot at work now, and in the process of creating my last post, I stumbled across this [cheat sheet for developing with Drupal][1]. 

I had no idea could pull `ddebug_backtrace()`  to get an instant stacktrace, or `DARGS()` to see the arguments being passing into a function at any point, or `DD()` to log directly to a text file (which you can tail in a terminal window to see stuff as it happens).

Now, if only Simpletest wasn't so depressingly slow...
