I've been working a project that used a very old git repo, and when I tried to run commit, I was greeted with this particular gem, over and over:
<pre><code>
Git: You have some suspicious patch linesâ€¦
(endless whining about whitespace and tabs and other petty crap
</code></pre>
This gets pretty tiresome, but fortunately, it's quite easy to fix. You can either run <code>git commit</code> with the <code>--noverify</code> flag, or for a more permanent fix, take by taking out the executable bit on the pre-commit hook like so:
<pre><code>
cd .git/hooks/ # go to the directory where the git hooks are
chmod -x pre-commit #metaphorically speaking, take a crow bar its kneecaps
</code></pre>
Mercifully, this little feat of silicon skullduggery is already done for you in more recent git versions, so you needn't dirty your hands.
