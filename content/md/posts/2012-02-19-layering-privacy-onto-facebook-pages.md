Can't say I expected to see this, but I'm impressed by the ingenuity. 

Someone's written a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eplekfcbehiijhdllcjenbokkmajncjl/) that encrypts and decrypts the content of messages on a Facebook group, but only if: 

* the person viewing the group has the appropriate extension for chrome
* they have the correct crypto key shared within the group (outside of Facebook, natch)

All anyone else see if they don't have the correct key is a load of jumbled text like so:

But if they have the key, their browser presents it as:

<a href="http://chrisadams.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/encrypted-facebook-groups1_thumb.jpg"><img src="http://chrisadams.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/encrypted-facebook-groups1_thumb.jpg" alt="" title="encrypted-facebook-groups1_thumb" width="473" height="220" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-663" /></a>

Interesting how identity and privacy protection is pushed into the browser, to allow for somewhat secure communication on an otherwise compromised platform - you get the network effects of Facebook, without having to trust the network.
