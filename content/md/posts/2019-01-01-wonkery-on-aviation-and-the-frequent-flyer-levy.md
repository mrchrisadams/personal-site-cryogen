<p>I'm dashing out this post out now, mainly so I can come back to it later, and share this with others and build on it. It might suck. Sorry 'bout that.</p>

<p>Over the Christmas holidays I read a couple of reports from AFreeRide.org - one was about Electric Aviation, and here's <a href="https://twitter.com/a_free_ride/status/1076801964539813888">the TLDR thread on twitter:</a></p>

<p>The other one was a policy proposal or something called the Frequent Flyer Levy, a policy proposal for doing something about the fact that flying</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>emits huge amounts of CO2</li><li>is subsidised massively compared to other forms of transport</li><li>pretty much feels like the final taboo when it comes to talking about personal actions and climate change</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The general idea of the policy is as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Everyone</strong> gets one tax free return flight each year.</p><p>Tax kicks in at a low rate from the second flight, then goes up a notch for each extra flight in that year.</p><p>The extra money is set aside to support greener alternatives to flying.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like this, as the majority of flights come from a tiny proportion of travellers - something like 70% of flights are by 15% of the population, and more than half of people in the UK don't fly each year anyway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just having a blanket tax on flying ends up hitting poorer people who make the occasional flight harder than people who are frequent flyers, so a progressive scale interested me, and I tried plugging in my last year's of flights into it to get an idea of what impact the policy would have had on me.</p>

<p>Why so many flights? Well, after losing a suitcase with loads of stuff on a really crappy train journey from London to Berlin in Nov '17, I did a pretty childish thing and basically ragequit international train travel, breaking a decent run of travelling by train almost everywhere over the last few years.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, when you total up the cost of flying <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ga_R2sxvjtVi0zCC4wBx6yjnE2MyhFpAxhtkRkguCEU/edit#gid=0">in the spreadsheet</a>, the impact is that this levy would have increased the cost of flying for me to the tune of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ga_R2sxvjtVi0zCC4wBx6yjnE2MyhFpAxhtkRkguCEU/edit#gid=0">more than 800 euros</a>. That's definitely enough to have made me choose trains for the earlier journeys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, in my case, I bought the flight for Bali the year before, so really, I guess I should have that in a separate year - doing this would mean the tax difference would have been much less - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ga_R2sxvjtVi0zCC4wBx6yjnE2MyhFpAxhtkRkguCEU/edit#gid=493893803">a little under a hundred EUR</a>. That's much less, and the train would still have been pricier, but not much pricier. For anything after those 4 flights, I'd have a much stronger incentive to not fly though, and I can see myself choosing the train, or simply not going as a result. </p>

<h3>Try it out yourself.</h3>

<p>I put this into Google Sheets, as I'm curious about how others who think about their flying too think this scheme seems fair, and if it would affect their behaviour.</p>

<h4>Yeah, but would this ever become policy?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I honestly don't know. In the UK though, it looks like the labour government is interested enough in the idea to be considering as policy, based this interview here with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/01/time-for-politicians-to-make-stark-choices-over-climate-change">Clive Lewis, mentioning a tax escalator for frequent fliers.</a> That's the closest thing I've seen so far, but it's food for thought.</p>
