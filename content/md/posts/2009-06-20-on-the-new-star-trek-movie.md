I chuffing loved it.

Clever, funny, well paced, and brilliantly shot. If you take the film as a typical summer blockbuster it delivers; it's immensely entertaining, the cast unformily photogenic, and the special effects are thrilling.

If you have any knowledge of the previous series though, there's a whole extra layer of in-jokes and references to the TV series that it's based on; in particular, the scene justifying breaking from canonical TV series is a masterstroke of tongue in cheek dialogue, but amazingly doesn't feel too laboured like it so easily could have.

It's really, really good fun. Go see it.
