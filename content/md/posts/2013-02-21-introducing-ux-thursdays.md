For the last few years, I've been keeping a scrapbook where I screenshot or take photos of clever little design ideas, either online, in products, or in the built environment, that either gracefully guide behaviour in a particular direction, or otherwise represent some noteworthy example of considered interaction design.
<h3>Sharing one, each week</h3>
They'd be more useful shared online than just on my 'pooter, and this blog seems a good a place as any other.

So, every Thursday, for as long as I can keep it up, I'll be posting something from my scrapbook onto this blog for your perusal, dear reader.

Let's see if this works.
