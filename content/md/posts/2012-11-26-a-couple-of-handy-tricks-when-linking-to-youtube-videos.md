I find myself using these tricks quite ofton when linking to youtube videos, and I figure they're worth sharing.

### Lets say I'm sharing this video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=pG342sCiYOA

There's a few tricks I can use to 

1. make the link shorter
2. link to a specific point in the video more easily.

## Making the link shorter 

The first thing to bear in mind is that one thing Youtube did with all the acquisition money was buy a belgian `.be` domain name, `youtu.be`, purely to make shorter links.

You can use this to shorten a video link from the long form: 

    http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=pG342sCiYOA

…to the terser belgian flavoured link:

## Linking to a specific point

You can link to a specific point in a youtube video by adding a little snippet of text to the end too. Lets say in this video I want to link to the part in this chinese parkour video featuring possible the most foolhardy jump I've seen ever, I can link directly by passing in the url the time to advance the video by, by adding a snippet like so:

    #t=1m45s

I remember this like "time offset equals 1 minute 45 seconds".

Here’s an example in use with our video. I defy you to not watch that through your fingers.

Now, go forth, and amaze your friends with your new youtube-fu.

Or, just watch some parkour.
