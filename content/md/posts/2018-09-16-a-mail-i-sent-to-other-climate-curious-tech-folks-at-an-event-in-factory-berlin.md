<div dir="ltr">Earlier this week, I went to an event run at Factory Berlin, about the use of data journalism in policy changes for social impact.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">I got talking about <a href="http://climateaction.tech/">Climate Action tech</a> with some people there, and as we don't have a formal regular newsletter we'd manage with something like Mailchimp, I wrote this email, then sent it along to the people who gave me their email address.</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>

<div dir="ltr">In case it's useful to anyone else, I've added it here too.</div>

Hi folks,

Thanks for signing up for this one off email, and listening to me ramble somewhat incoherently earlier at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/290757378379073/">Change The Story, Change The World: Data-Driven Social Impact event at Factory Berlin.</a>

I said I’d share a few links afterwards for those interested in the intersection between tech and climate, and a few places to look to satisfy your curiosity.

<div>I'll be deleting the form and data in it at the end of this month, but you're very welcome to get in touch, by replying to this email or DMing me on twitter - I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/mrchrisadams">@mrchrisadams</a>.</div>

<div dir="ltr"><b>ClimateAction.Tech</b>
<a href="http://climateaction.tech/">http://climateaction.tech/</a>This is the group I joined earlier this year. They’ve been going for about two years, and are comprised mainly of employees in tech companies, trying to bring about action inside companies to adopt more climate friendly policies.  These two posts give some useful background:

</a>
Among other things, they run an accelerator where employees in companies can find other like minded people in other places, and receive mentorship from specialists or people in leadership roles in other companies (i.e  previous mentors have included the director of sustainability at Facebook and Salesforce, for example.)

You can see an example  of some work that Mapbox (a mapping company who are used in loads of other products) , and Wikimedia Foundation (the folks behind Wikipedia)

So far, most of their efforts have been working directly with tech companies in the US, but they’re starting to do more public engagement stuff now, to find more people interested in doing something about climate change. We're looking for people to get involved in both public comms, and maaaybe even replicating the accelerator elsewhere. Please get in touch if this sounds interesting to you.

<b>Some talks I’ve done about climate and tech, and what steps we have available to us

Some work I’ve been doing to work out how much of the web runs on renewable power (it links to the jupyter note book I use to show my workings)

A little more about the the deep, underlying reasons as someone in tech you might care about climate change
