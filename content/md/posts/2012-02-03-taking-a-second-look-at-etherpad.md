I watched this video today, after speaking to some of the govuk people at MonkiGras - they've been using an in house tool called the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/meetingotron" title="Meeting o tron">Meeting-o-Tron</a> to track who's doing what after meetings, by letting anyone edit the notes in realtime.
