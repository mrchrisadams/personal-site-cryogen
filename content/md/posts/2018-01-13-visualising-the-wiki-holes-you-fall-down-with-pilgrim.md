I just came across <a href="http://pilgrim.are.na/">Pilgrim</a>, an interesting web thing that converts pages inrto a more readable, ad-free version of their form self, but also visualises the links you click to get an map out where you end up going as you look through it.

I'm finding these tools, and ones like <a href="http://hypothes.is/">hypothesis</a>, and <a href="https://getpocket.com/blog/2017/12/highlighting-has-arrived-in-pocket-for-android/">Pockets' recent experiments in highlighting text</a> in their app interesting lately.

Not sure what I'll do it, but who knows, maybe it'll be useful to refer back to it in future.
