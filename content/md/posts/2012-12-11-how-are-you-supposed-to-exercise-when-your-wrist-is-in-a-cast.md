Silly question time.

I have a cast on my left wrist from crashing my bike. It looks a lot like this:

<a href="http://chrisadams.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/7661144_WqPVWg3ifcQYHNgnx1n8xiF9D6y7nPwP_5xuAh_yNsI.jpeg"><img src="http://chrisadams.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/7661144_WqPVWg3ifcQYHNgnx1n8xiF9D6y7nPwP_5xuAh_yNsI.jpeg" alt="7661144_WqPVWg3ifcQYHNgnx1n8xiF9D6y7nPwP_5xuAh_yNsI" width="540" height="540" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-835" /></a>

I shouldn't get it wet, and I have to shower with it in some comical arm-condom contraption from Limbo.

I also miss exercise massively, but the idea of exercising and therefore sweating into a cast that can't wash for weeks doesn't exactly sound attractive.

What are you supposed to do if you want to stay active and retain some fitness over the 6+ weeks you're in plaster?
