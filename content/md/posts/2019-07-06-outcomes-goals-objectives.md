<p>This diagram from Jamie Arnold turned up in my timeline yesterday, and it I liked it so much, that seemed worth a quick write up:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0kysh1WkAAiABL?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="" /><figcaption>Outcomes, goals and objectives - way to talk about what you're doing</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think a nice way to frame it:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A <strong>Goal</strong> in this case is broad direction  you're heading in. Head in this direction!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An <strong>Outcome</strong> is the benefit from achieving this goal. This is where you arrive</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>Objective</strong> is the specific, measurable, time-bound thing you'd need to meet reach this outcome</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A <strong>Deliverable</strong> is a thing, like an artefact or similar, you might produce, that ideally would achieve the objective or goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Why I like it</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like it, as it's bit more detailed than when people try to come up with   <strong>missions</strong> vs <strong>vision</strong>s for working out what they're trying to do, and provides a nice way to go from something high level and aspirational, to something you can point for working on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mission</strong> - the reason you exist, the thing you to reach the state you describe in your vision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Vision</strong> - the ideal state you'd be in, if what you're doing works out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An example from the mission and vision statement for <a href="http://climateaction.tech/">Climate Action Tech</a>, a group I work with, might help in this case:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Mission:</strong> We empower technology professionals to take climate action</p><p><strong>Vision:</strong> Everyone is working on the climate crisis at all levels, and driving industry and society toward a sustainable future.</p><cite>Climate Action Tech  mission and vision statement as of Jun 2019</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Complementary tools</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It also seems to be complementary to <a href="https://www.impactmapping.org/">Impact Mapping</a>, which is another fairly useful tool for framing what you're looking to do on a project, or inside an organisation. I like this, as they're explicit about who you're aiming some kind of intervention or initiative at</p>
