I really like [Alec's post here][1], where he outlines the results of an experiment where instead of farting thoughts onto twitter straightaway, he's composing content on his blog, then only using twitter to post links to it.

His argument for why isn't exactly new, but I like how he frames Twitter as a channel for linking to content you've written, where you're no longer constricted by the 140 character limit, and where a fuller conversation can be held.

In fact, I think I'm going to try it out myself as the default way of posting written content online for a week, to see how it affects my own blogging patterns.

If nothing else, it should help me get better at posts out of the drafts folder, and into wild...
