I've been trying to get back up to speed again with javascript recently, and with all the new features being added each year, I'm starting to like it much more than I did before. Try as I might, though I hadn't really got my head around how to use generators, or when they might be useful.

After seeing this talk here by Yulia Startsev, it's making a lot more sense - the talk gives some useful background on how the nicer new async/await syntactic sugar is made possible with generators and gives some nice background on how the new Firefox debugger is built and works.

It's not short (45 minutes), but if like me, you've been feeling a bit shaky about some of the new Promise and generator synatx in newer javascript, it's a worth a look.
